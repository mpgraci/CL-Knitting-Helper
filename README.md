# CL-Knitting-Helper

Knitting Helper is a console app designed to aid knitters in keeping tack of inventory and doing guage calcualtions. Users can add, remove, and view an inventory of needles and yarn. Additionally, users can calculage the gauge for a project based on a common 4inch by 4inch swatch. 

Enter "dotnet run" to run the application in Command Prompt or Powershell.

Code Louisville features: 

-Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

-Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

-Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application

-Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
